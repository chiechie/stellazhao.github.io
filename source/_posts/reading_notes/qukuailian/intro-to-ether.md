Patrick访谈以太坊组织的研究人员--Justin，内容包括：

- 以太坊和比特币的区别
- 以太坊平台孵化的项目数量日益增长
- 共识算法从工作量证明到权益证明的转变，对以太坊的意义



## Key Concepts of BTC
1. 以太坊（Ethereum）诞生于2015年，是一个去中心化的区块链（blockchain），类似的概念是Bitcoin。
2. 以太坊的平台原生加密货币是以太（Ether），类似的概念是BTC。
3. 以太坊网络的交易费用每天达到1500w美元，需求日益增长。
4. 区块链是一个协作平台（coordination platform），让互联网上的人们即使不认识不信任彼此，也可以协作。
5. 互联网是区块链的第一个阶段，它的使命是冲破地域限制，让世界各地的人可以commmuniction。区块链是对这一能力的拓展，它可以让彼此不信任对方的现状下，人跟人仍然能协作。它的信任来自代码，数学，技术，而不是人。
6. 货币的本质，一个账本，这个账本记录每个人有多少购买力。比特币本质也是账本，记录每个人有多少比特币。
7. 关于安全性有哪些必备条件，可参考最安全的东西--时间。时间有3个属性，过去的不可篡改。第二个属性是，当下，对所有人，是一个共享的体验（shared experience）。第三个属性是，未来是确定的，一定会发生，没有任何人能够阻止。
8. 回到货币上，过去的交易不可篡改，每个人都能信任比特币的状态，不用第三方。绕开审查（Censorship resistance），如果比特币是一个计算器，以太坊就是一个计算机。
9. 矿工让彼此不信任的人达成共识，理应获得报酬--BTC。


## 以太坊

1. what was the original impetus（动力） in early history here? 
2. Why was Ethereum created?
3. What shortcomings of Bitcoin did it seek to address in the early days?
1. 比特币的编程能力有限，以太坊扩展了变成能力。
2. 说一说以太坊创始人Vitalik的想法？
3. 权益证明比工作量证明，更便宜，因为货币的机会成本更低？？啥意思
4. The rewards that you get as a validator are, number one, issuance but also these tips that don't get burnt.
5. The way that we do ownership really in the crypto world is using public keys. It's basically cryptography that allows you to prove that you're the owner of something. What it means to go buy an NFT is, at the end of the day, to basically change this ledger entry to add your public key as the owner of this hash.
6. We have, right now, 130,000 validators that are securing the proof-of-stake in Ethereum. This is going to grow to half a million or even close to a million validators. Another thing that is important is to understand that the proof-of-stake is best-in-class in terms of security. Just to give you one compelling reason for that is that when we have this scarce resource securing your consensus engine being money placed as collateral, you have the option to destroy it fully. If an attacker is in a position to be able to attack Ethereum, meaning that it has amassed all these economic resources, well, as soon as they make an attack, we can penalize them and remove them from the system so the system is self-healing. Actually, because there's only a finite number of ETH out there, we can actually put an upper bound on the number of times that an attacker can successfully make an attack. It's on the order of 10 times
7. Be intellectually curious, be intellectually honest in the sense that participating in things that you understand and whenever there's something you don't understand, don't be shy to ask questions. There's a lot of information out there. Actually, on that point a lot of information out there, there's also a lot of bad information out there. This is a very organic, decentralized, and chaotic space.
